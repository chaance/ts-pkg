<h1 align="center">tspkg</h1>

A starter template for creating TypeScript packages. Pre-configured with:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

## Getting Started

Author your package in `src/`. By default, the entrypoint is `src/index.ts`. Multiple entrypoints can be configured in `tsup.config.ts`.

Build your package with `npm run build`. This will output the compiled package to `dist/` and ... you're done! Your package is ready to publish. Kick back and enjoy your new OSS package.
